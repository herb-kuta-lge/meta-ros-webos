`meta-ros-webos` is the OpenEmbedded layer for interfacing between `meta-ros`
and webOS OSE.

As of 2020-07-22, this branch can be used to build meta-ros layers for
webOS OSE 2.6 on Ubuntu **bionic**. Multiple sublayers must be used. See
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions)
for instructions.
